# Detailed documentation of the Tri-Lattice Projector program

## Purpose

This program projects the tri-concepts on one of the 3 dimensions by building a SOFIA context corresponding 
to their projection (tri-concepts as objects and elements of the projection dimension as attributes). 
SOFIA can then be used to build the order corresponding to this projection.

## Execution

This program can be executed with:

```bash
python trilatticeProjector.py trilattice ontology_base_uri projection_context [-d | --dimension]
```

with:

* _trilattice_: file containing the trilattice generated by DataPeeler
* _ontology_base_uri_: ontology base URI
* _projection_context_: file containing the 2D context equivalent to the projection
* _-d | --dimension_: dimension to project on. Choices are: objects, attributes, conditions (default)
