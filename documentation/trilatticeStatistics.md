# Detailed documentation of the Tri-Lattice Statistics program

## Purpose

This program computes statistics on a tri-lattice generated by DataPeeler:

* Number of tri-concepts

## Execution

This program can be executed with:

```bash
python trilatticeStatistics.py trilattice statisticsn
```

with:

* _trilattice_: file containing the trilattice generated by DataPeeler
* _statistics_: file where the statistics of the trilattice will be stored
