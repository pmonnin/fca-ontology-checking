# fca-ontology-checking

Using FCA for checking the structure of an ontology

## Programs available and workflow

### Context creation

This program builds a SOFIA context from a set of queries to select objects and their associated 
attributes. Statistics are computed on this context.

* [Detailed documentation is available](documentation/contextCreation.md)
* [Example of program configuration is available](examples/conf-context-creation.json)

### Lattice statistics

This program computes statistics on a lattice generated by SOFIA.

* [Detailed documentation is available](documentation/latticeStatistics.md)

### Lattice annotator

This programs annotates a lattice generated by SOFIA, extracts subsumption axioms from it and compare the extracted 
axioms with existing axioms in the ontology. Statistics are computed on the associated ontology and the extracted 
axioms.

* [Detailed documentation is available](documentation/latticeAnnotator.md)
* [Example of program configuration is available](examples/conf-lattice-annotation.json)

## Dependencies

* Python 3.6.1
